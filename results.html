<div id="panelY">This personality test randomly generates a character and does not take any of your answers into account. There is a slight chance that it randomly did generate the character closest to your personality, but studies have shown that humans lean toward believing the internet when they are uncertain. This goes to show that you cannot always believe what the internet says because a good amount of the time, developers are just trying to persuade you to believe what they want you to believe, not what is actually true.

Be on the look out for this type of psychological game used in other websites!
