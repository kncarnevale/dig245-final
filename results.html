      This personality test randomly generates a character and does not take any of your answers into account. Studies have shown that humans lean toward believing the internet when they are uncertain. It is very easy to persuade a user to believe they are a certain personality or that something may happen to them based on their horoscopes, since most of the answers are so vague that they might match with anyone and everyone. This goes to show that developers are just trying to convince you to believe what they want you to think is the truth, when in reality it is all made up. In conclusion, you cannot always believe what the internet has to say.
    <br>
    Now that you are aware of this, be on the look out for this type of psychological game used in other websites!
